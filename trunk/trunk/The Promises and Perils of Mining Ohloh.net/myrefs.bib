title = {Continuous Integration in Open Source Software Development},
abstract = {Commercial software firms are increasingly using and contributing 
to open source software. Thus, they need to understand and work with open 
source software development processes. This paper investigates whether the 
practice of continuous integration of agile software development methods has had an impact on open source software projects. Using fine-granular data from more than 5000 active open source software projects we analyze the size of code contributions over a project's life-span. Code contribution size has stayed 
flat. We interpret this to mean that open source software development has not 
changed its code integration practices. In particular, within the limits of this 
study, we claim that the practice of continuous integration has not yet signifi-cantly influenced the behavior of open source software developers. },
